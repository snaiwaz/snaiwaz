Hi, I'm snaiwaz, a novice Linux and Programming Enthusiast.

Currently my GitHub only contains a backup of my dotfiles aswell as small projects, but feel free to look around.

If you're interested in any of my SysAdmin-oriented projects, you can check out my website at koishi.de, now hosting my own instance of searX at searx.koishi.de
